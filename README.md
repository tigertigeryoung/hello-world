# hello-world
The first time try to do sth. on GitHub.

Hello GitHub, I'm coming. I'm learning Python and trying to work on computer vision using deep-learning.
This is the first time to use GitHub. This repo is a start to surf in the ocean of coding.

# Change kernel of jupyter notebook

1. In the base environment, pip install ipykernel
2. In the base environment, use command: python -m ipykernel install --user --new(the name of the environment) pytorch(the name you prefer to disply in jupyter) 
3. Generally, the kernel files will be generated in C:\Users\(the user name)\AppData\Roaming\jupyter\kernels, the path of the python interpreters can be changed manually in those files.
